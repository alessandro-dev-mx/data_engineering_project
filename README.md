# Data Engineering Project (DE Project)

The **Data Engineering Project** has as main goal to demonstrate how to properly design and develop two things:
- ETL Project
- REST API

This project consists of designing a database to load data based on a sample file shared by our client. Its creation, initial data load, and usage as part of a CRUD API are part of the considerations of such design.

Another relevant component of the project is the development of the different pieces considered relevant during the design process.

## Requirements

- The project can be built with Docker (Compose)
- The project is based on both the Docker compose and sample data files provided by our clients
- All the services can be executed and tested by using Docker (Compose)
- The initial data load happens by pushing the data from the Cent OS machine built with Docker
- The API supports the following actions:
    - Read mechanism to fetch data from the database (must)
    - *Insert mechanism (optional)*
    - *Update mechanism (optional)*
    - *Delete mechanism (optional)*
- The server where the API is going to be deployed must have access only to the postgres
database. And the centos server must have access only to the postgres database as well
